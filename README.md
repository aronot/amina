# amazee.io Tech-Assessment 2020

Hi ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking your time to get your hands dirty with our tech assessment.

As always there is no wrong solution as long as it fixes the goals
outlined in the objectives below.

And now, enjoy.

**Timelimit:** 4 hours

**Objectives:**
- Deploy Application in `app1` into a local [K3s](https://k3s.io/) Instance. Use whatever tool you like to deploy it.
- Deploy Application in `app2` into the local K3s Instance. There are existing k8s YAML files in the folder, use these! But be warned: Tt might need some debugging to get the application running.
- Automate the steps to install k3s, build and deploy the two apps so it can be **ran and tested on another linux or mac machine in one single command.**
- Document your all learnings, reasoning and path to a solution into the `DOCUMENTATION.md` and commit it together with your solution back to the git repository under the [amazeeio-assessment](https://github.com/amazeeio-assessment) organisation on github.
- Remember: We're not looking for a perfect solution we're looking for the path you take to solve the assessment. Even if you don't get everything working - show what do did and document your steps.
